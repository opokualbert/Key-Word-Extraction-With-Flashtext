       "139   Colonial Tourism at the Green Ranch - that's why I recommend the Coco Village Guesthouse\\n\\nIn South Africa, excursions are now offered to the townships - the poorest of the poor as a tourist attraction. The safaris through the vast steppes of Africa are to serve the African clichÃ©s of Western tourists, who owe their support to the media.\\n\\nA particularly perfidious example of colonial tourism is the Green Ranch on Lake Bosumtwe in Ghana. On horseback, tourists can enjoy the bitter poverty of people living in mud huts and then round off the event with an expensive vegan meal.\\n\\nThe owner (a swiss lady) rides her horses through the clear water of the lake (please have a look at the photos on the website), which pollute the animals with their feces. THE SAME WATER SERVES THE RESIDENTS AS DRINKING WATER, who repeatedly suffer from diseases caused by contaminated water. People have to drink dirty water in order for the hotel's entertainment-oriented t concept to flourish.\\n\\nIf you a...   \n",

       "      <td>My first stay here was unpleasant ; the bathroom window was spoilt, meaning I either left it open to let in fresh air and mosquitoes, or shut it and endure the stuffiness. I reported that to the receptionist everyday I was there, (spent an entire week there) yet it was never fixed. The bathroom tiles and sinks were visibly stained with grime and mold, but the water pressure was very fantastic. \\nThe comforter stunk of urine, and when I complained, was replaced with another one which stunk of damp. Their bedsheets also had a funny odor I never could wrap my head around. The restaurant doesn't open until after 7am, thus delaying breakfast. \\nI was offered the same room above on my second visit, which I declined because the window had still not been fixed although it was almost 2 months after my first.

       "139   Colonial Tourism at the Green Ranch - that's why I recommend the Coco Village Guesthouse\\n\\nIn South Africa, excursions are now offered to the townships - the poorest of the poor as a tourist attraction. The safaris through the vast steppes of Africa are to serve the African clichÃ©s of Western tourists, who owe their support to the media.\\n\\nA particularly perfidious example of colonial tourism is the Green Ranch on Lake Bosumtwe in Ghana. On horseback, tourists can enjoy the bitter poverty of people living in mud huts and then round off the event with an expensive vegan meal.\\n\\nThe owner (a swiss lady) rides her horses through the clear water of the lake (please have a look at the photos on the website), which pollute the animals with their feces. THE SAME WATER SERVES THE RESIDENTS AS DRINKING WATER, who repeatedly suffer from diseases caused by contaminated water. People have to drink dirty water in order for the hotel's entertainment-oriented t concept to flourish.\\n\\nIf you a...   \n",

The receptionist promised it'll be fixed the next day but that never happened during my 4 day stay. The bathroom was too narrow for even one person let alone 2 to fit in there comfortably. I had to bath in a restricted position lest my body touched the walls, which weren't exactly the neatest. \\nI loved the layout of the room though, and the bed was very soft.

The safaris through the vast steppes of Africa are to serve the African clichÃ©s of Western tourists, who owe their support to the media.\\n\\nA particularly perfidious example of colonial tourism is the Green Ranch on Lake Bosumtwe in Ghana. On horseback, tourists can enjoy the bitter poverty of people living in mud huts and then round off the event with an expensive vegan meal.\\n\\nThe owner (a swiss lady) rides her horses through the clear water of the lake (please have a look at the photos on the website), which pollute the animals with their feces.

       "139   Colonial Tourism at the Green Ranch - that's why I recommend the Coco Village Guesthouse\\n\\nIn South Africa, excursions are now offered to the townships - the poorest of the poor as a tourist attraction. The safaris through the vast steppes of Africa are to serve the African clichÃ©s of Western tourists, who owe their support to the media.\\n\\nA particularly perfidious example of colonial tourism is the Green Ranch on Lake Bosumtwe in Ghana. On horseback, tourists can enjoy the bitter poverty of people living in mud huts and then round off the event with an expensive vegan meal.\\n\\nThe owner (a swiss lady) rides her horses through the clear water of the lake (please have a look at the photos on the website), which pollute the animals with their feces. THE SAME WATER SERVES THE RESIDENTS AS DRINKING WATER, who repeatedly suffer from diseases caused by contaminated water. People have to drink dirty water in order for the hotel's entertainment-oriented t concept to flourish.\\n\\nIf you a...   \n",

The receptionist promised it'll be fixed the next day but that never happened during my 4 day stay. The bathroom was too narrow for even one person let alone 2 to fit in there comfortably. I had to bath in a restricted position lest my body touched the walls, which weren't exactly the neatest. \\nI loved the layout of the room though, and the bed was very soft.

Key lime pie was disgusting - DO NOT order. The owner was drinking behind the bar, then sitting at the bar drinking. To be honest, if you take your business serious you should either be working or socializing. I think this place would be perfect on the show \"Bar Rescue\" if it ever went international.

       "1914  My first stay here was unpleasant ; the bathroom window was spoilt, meaning I either left it open to let in fresh air and mosquitoes, or shut it and endure the stuffiness. I reported that to the receptionist everyday I was there, (spent an entire week there) yet it was never fixed. The bathroom tiles and sinks were visibly stained with grime and mold, but the water pressure was very fantastic. \\nThe comforter stunk of urine, and when I complained, was replaced with another one which stunk of damp. Their bedsheets also had a funny odor I never could wrap my head around. The restaurant doesn't open until after 7am, thus delaying breakfast. \\nI was offered the same room above on my second visit, which I declined because the window had still not been fixed although it was almost 2 months after my first. The next room I was offered had mosquitoes, that unmistakable stench in their bedsheets and pillow cases, same dirty tiles and sinks  in the washroom, only with a good washroom window. ...   \n",
